          Let's continue our exploration from the safety and comfort of our submarine.
          Right now, we are in the Transition Zone between Twilight and Midnight zone (around 600 meters below sea level).
          Let's go deeper into the Midnight Zone - a place of utter darkness.

          The Midnight Zone is a barely explored wet wasteland consisting of nothing but endless black open water.
          No sunlight is able to reach this deep. You are having a view of it only through our efficient light beams.
          Finding food down here is really hard, so life had to adapt, and become extremely energy effecient.
          To know about the animals down here, hover on their names on the right.

            Titanic. After all, we don't have adequate tissue paper for you] The only time the animals living in this zone move fast is when they have 
            to escape danger. The sea-floor in this zone is known as the Abyssal Plain which is covered in grey mud
            and rocks dusted with the remains of marine snow (this marine snow is consumed by some sea animals like
            sea cucumbers, shrimp, sea urchins and sea worms).

            We have now entered the Hadal Zone - the underworld of the sea. It consists of long narrow trenches
            that are among the most extreme environments on Earth.
            Only extremophiles exist down here, like the ethereal snailfish which holds the record for the 
            deepest living fish ever seen, at around 8,000 meters.

          Did you know that two men onboard 
          the submarine Trieste descended into the Mariana Trench and reached
          the deepest point in the ocean (around 11,000 meters below sea level).
          <br>
          But our faithful submarine is not as strong as the mighty Trieste to make such a descent.
          So, unfortunately, we will have to end our quest and go back.
          Please do get a hold on your emoceons.<br>
          Click on the submarine to go back to the surface of the sea.
